## Installing dependencies

- Dependencies are installed in the root directory (and saved to Git) so that they are available in the lambda runtime.
- To update/add dependencies, update the `requirements.txt` and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt -t .` to install dependencies in the root directory.
